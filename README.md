# üëã Hi, I'm Michael Despo!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a seasoned technology leader pivoting into machine learning and data science to drive innovation. After completing MIT‚Äôs Professional Full Stack Development with MERN program, I've developed object-oriented programming skills (Python, JavaScript) and am actively expanding my expertise in AI-driven solutions. Building on my MIT training, I‚Äôm now excited to further my technical journey as Masters of Computer Science candidate at UC Boulder and through additional specialized coursework. 

As a machine learning engineer/data scientist, full-stack developer, and senior program/project manager, I am focused on building scalable models to drive strategic decisions across organizations to boost lead generation, maximize revenue growth, and reduce both costs and time. Over my career, I've held leadership roles‚Äîas a former Director of Consulting at Citisoft and as the Founder of my own real estate wholesale company‚Äîthriving at the intersection of engineering, strategy, and execution.
